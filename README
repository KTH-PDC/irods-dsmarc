This is the README file for the dsmarc utility.

The dsmarc utility is a replacement for the iRODS Universal mass storage
interface script, 'univMSSInterface.sh'. It is a simple C program which
performs the same functions, using the TSM C API.

The program accepts the MSS arguments which are:
    syncToArch f     to copy from cache to MSS.
    stageToCache f   to stage from MSS to cache.
    mkdir d          to create a directory in the MSS.
    chmod f mode     to modify ACLs in the MSS for a given
                     directory. There is no functionality
                     for this in TSM. It is ignored.
    rm file          to remove a file from the MSS.
    mv f1 f2         to rename a file in the MSS.
                     It is not possible to rename an archive
                     object in TSM. The file will be copied and
                     then the old one removed
    stat file        to do a stat on a file. Return result in iRODS
                     format.
Additional documentation is provided with the manual page.
The program also gives help using the argument -h.

In this directory you find:
    README          this file.
    Makefile        is the make file
    dsmarc.c        The C source file for the utility.
    dsmarc.man      Manual page for the dsmarc utility. Copy it to the
                    manual pages directory or display it with nroff -man.
    include         is a directory with the copy of the TSM API include
                    files as provided with the API samples. You shuld make
                    sure you got the correct version here.

The make file contains compile-time options which could be customized.
It accepts the following targets:
    clean           clean up, remove objects and binaries.
    distclean       same as clen, in this case.
    install         move the executable under the iRODS destination.
                    Run it as user irods.
    uninstall       undo install.
    dist            create distribution tarball.
    save            creates save tarball.
    test            run basic tests.
    rootinstall     install root part, to run it as root.
    rootuninstall   uninstall root part.

It requires the TSM API package to be installed. Will use the library
from that package.

The TSM API should be configured with the dsm.sys and dsm.opt files in
the API client directory, the exact same way as the TSM client.
